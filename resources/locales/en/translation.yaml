                📮 Using this command, you can #*anonymously#* report any problem in the space (something is missing, something doesn’t work, someone is doing something very wrong in the space).
                Residents will definitely consider it and try to resolve it.

                You can send a problem to the bot, for example, like this:
                #`/issue The air conditioner does not work well and it is very hot on the first floor#`
                #`/issue Out of toilet paper#`
                #`/issue It would be nice to have a map of the internal network on the wiki#`

                If the issue is related to our bot, then it is better to use the /bug command
            sent: 💌 The problem has been sent to residents, they will definitely consider it. Thank you for helping our community.

                #`/bug The automatic check-in doesn't work when I come to the space#`

                Your #*username will be automatically added#* to the message so that residents can contact you if they need additional information.

                If the issue is related to the space itself, then it is better to use the /issue command
            sent: 💌 The bug report has been sent to the maintainers, they will definitely review it. Thank you for helping our community.
