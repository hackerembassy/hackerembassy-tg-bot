PSU: 600W *(not sure, but it's BIG)*, 12V *(that sucks, I know*)\n2. Motherboard: SKR 1.4 Turbo\\n*Quirk: pins for second extruder heater are used instead for a heatsink fan on the on the first (and only) extruder, so the heatsink fan can have PWM and turn on only when needed.*\n3. Installed drivers: All a4488 *(good for extruder and Z, but for XY quiter drivers can be bought)*\n4. Firmware: **Klipper** ✨ (Marlin compatible)\n5. Build volume: 220x220x170 *(170mm height can be safely upped to 190mm in the firmware, I think)*\n6. Extruder:\n   \n   1. Trianglelab BMG dual geared extruder clone\n   2. Extruder motor: 1.8deg NEMA17 23MM (pancake)\n   3. Auto bed leveling sensor: original **BLTouch 3.1** ✨\n   4. Hotend: Trianglelab E3D V6 hotend clone\n      \n      1. Heat break: Trianglelab GRADE5 V6 titanium alloy heat break (**Fullmetal** ✨)\n      2. Heater cartridge: Trianglelab 6\\*20MM 12V / 24V 50W\n      3. Silicone sock *(please take it off when heating nozzle >250C)*\n      4. Trianglelab T-D500 Temperature Sensor 500℃ *(provides unprecise measurements with temps below 100C, but it's okay)*\n      5. Various [assortment of V6 nozzles]\n7. Heat Bed:\n\n   1. 200x200mmm silicone heater pad 200W *(not sure)*, works in parallel with the original 220x220x3 aluminium 120W heatbed\n   2. **Wham Bam Flexible Build System** ✨ [info](https://whambamsystems.com/flexible-build-system) and [short overview]*\n      \n      1. Wham Bam Flexi Magnetic Base (high temp-resistant up to 150 degrees with high temp 3M adhesive)\n      2. Wham Bam Flexi Build Plate (spring steel)\n      3. PEX Build Surface film on build plate\n\nThe are lots of printable changes. If some 3D printed part breaks, you can ask @ubershy, and she will provide models (or links to models) or even source files.\n\n## Display\n\nThere's an adapter for a display cable on EXT1 — and *it does a lot of re-pinning, so don't ignore it!*\\nEXT2 is only used for it's beeper pin, and **if plugged in directly will stop USB UART from working**.\\nYou only need one wire, as shown on a picture below\n\n## Useful links\n\nOur repo with templates, docs and other useful resources\\n<https://github.com/hackerembassy/printer-anette>\n","embedding":[-0.00043359966,0.036692996,0.012662506,-0.04874544,-0.06291078,-0.01660559,-0.057286307,-0.006997113,-0.033002865,-0.091360494,-0.011464701,-0.057197027,-0.0378536,-0.021858074,-0.007848968,0.019373188,0.012335155,0.0049511734,-0.04764435,0.07320744,0.17117445,0.02166464,0.12558348,-0.07999251,-0.047078926,-0.035800222,0.0013317206,-0.06249415,0.012989855,-0.017379327,-0.011330785,-0.08308746,-0.038478542,-0.021441447,-0.0926699,0.062315598,0.049578693,-0.03710962,-0.06469633,0.026277302,-0.0030224107,-0.025250614,0.0649344,0.013890069,-0.07398117,-0.0070901103,-0.002233794,0.06505343,0.00052961934,0.07731419,0.053328343,0.09874076,-0.079516366,0.011397743,-0.1377252,-0.0051966864,-0.058060043,-0.0141951,0.07148141,-0.020727227,0.017081734,0.03449082,0.052346293,-0.021114096,-0.012602987,0.023792416,-0.022081267,0.09868124,-0.005375241,0.037496492,0.098145574,0.03008647,-0.075528644,-0.07463587,0.031842258,-0.09540774,-0.045442175,0.095050626,-0.052108217,0.07219563,-0.14224859,0.00012229139,-0.09838365,-0.014336456,-0.02361386,-0.032556478,-0.13427314,-0.049548935,-0.1386775,0.02060819,-0.13165435,-0.019447586,-0.04794194,0.030681653,0.11492972,0.010118101,-0.0655891,-0.093919784,-0.010609126,0.005981583,0.122488536,0.018391136,-0.16296095,-0.20260009,0.08725374,-0.043864943,0.028910985,0.01046033,0.017498363,-0.039252277,-0.24176309,-0.0063758916,0.054548465,-0.02261693,-0.040680718,-0.03892493,0.0018627349,0.037436973,0.10243089,-0.05981583,-0.04428157,0.065112956,0.102788,0.01721565,0.0064130905,-0.07410021,-0.080349624,-0.010586807,-0.1396298,0.026560014,0.09939546,-0.053893767,0.04431133,-0.08719422,0.044489883,-0.06386307,-0.04553145,-0.032050572,-0.05957776,0.050203636,0.053000994,-0.0743978,0.08005203,0.016412154,0.013540399,0.05817908,-0.021381928,-0.05442943,-0.03993674,0.03419323,0.032229125,-0.016769264,-0.024610791,-0.12451216,-0.047108687,0.017200772,0.08505157,0.10772801,-0.12748806,-0.065529585,-0.017409084,0.0000075560265,-0.053000994,-0.021679519,-0.03109828,0.071898036,0.020712348,-0.055619795,-0.116536714,0.029416889,0.0075476565,0.06517247,-0.033925395,0.10302607,0.0010062302,-0.018093545,0.009589876,-0.111596696,-0.062434632,-0.027497426,0.048090737,0.011189429,-0.010646325,-0.047852665,-0.009061652,-0.0065321266,-0.034996726,0.042882893,-0.025637481,0.039163,0.07225514,0.064101145,0.01724541,0.03880589,0.0060522608,-0.072850324,0.09457448,-0.07898071,0.107608974,-0.055322204,-0.013957027,0.046215914,0.07755227,0.08237325,-0.010743042,-0.078504555,-0.07154092,0.08648,0.018108424,-0.014619168,0.010452891,-0.0047093807,0.049072787,0.013324646,-0.015757455,0.053864006,-0.018182822,0.103978366,0.013354405,0.12546445,-0.07475491,0.12100058,-0.0075253374,-0.02264669,0.044162534,0.0730884,0.039043967,-0.03249696,0.04835857,-0.007000833,0.014291817,0.048120495,-0.044698197,-0.028018212,-0.033657566,0.011271266,-0.026515376,0.000029018049,-0.009217887,-0.0020775585,-0.01487212,0.014351335,-0.009195568,0.06112523,0.06189897,-0.041127104,-0.107370906,-0.07535009,-0.030294783,0.010676084,0.08648,0.06826742,-0.05850643,0.011955726,0.034371782,-0.051840387]},{"file":"Donate item.md","text":"# Donate item\n\n# Донаты предметами\n\nСпейс также принимает донаты предметами. Правда тащить сюда всё, что плохо лежит или просто лежит давно и запылилось — не стоит.\n\n## Простой гайд, как понять, можно ли задонатить этот предмет в спейс\n\nДля каждого предмета, который ты хочешь принести, ответь на несколько вопросов:\n\n### **Эта штука работает?** \n\nЕсли это ноутбук — то он должен включаться и работать. Не вырубаться через 2 минуты. Если это принтер — он должен печатать. И не сваливатся через каждую страницу в ошибку «у меня не родной картридж». Если это монитор — он должен показывать изображение. Без условностей, типо полос или стробоскопа. \n\nЕсли штука не работает, но в ней могут быть полезные вещи внутри, не стоит тащить её «на разбор». Например: есть мёртвый ноутбук и ты думаешь, что его SSD и RAM могут быть полезны спейсу. \n\nМожно: принести ноутбук, разобрать его у нас нашими инструментами. Показать резидентам те детали, которые ты хотел бы задонатить, уточнить, нужны ли они в спейсе, если нужны — задонатить их. \n\nНельзя: принести ноутбук и сказать «ну эта, достаньте плиз из него, что надо.»\n\n### **Эта штука полезна для спейса?** \nНе нужно тащить в спейс ледоруб, ботинки, ещё одну миди-клавиатуру или ещё один паяльник.\n\nЛибо это не наш профиль, либо этих штук (паяльники, миди-клавиатуры) у нас и так довольно много, нам не нужно ещё. \n\nЕсли есть сомнения, в том, что вещь та, что надо — можно уточнить у нас в чате. В [основном] или Off-Topic. Их регулярно читают резиденты и мы подскажем по конкретному случаю.","embedding":[-0.011197302,0.08150952,-0.1571839,0.07093334,0.1137851,-0.07207301,-0.092450395,0.030588863,0.03207044,-0.05584405,-0.019089548,-0.03795116,0.055889636,-0.010029135,0.021380294,0.04205399,-0.067149624,-0.08201098,-0.12089667,0.06222623,0.044675242,0.15235169,0.04538184,-0.085840285,-0.02840069,-0.036469582,0.03742691,0.04421937,0.053610288,-0.0962797,0.014872752,-0.04198561,0.0009266978,-0.02755733,-0.08141834,0.050647136,-0.06450558,0.018155014,0.023955958,-0.04107387,-0.035899747,0.13402572,-0.030452102,-0.09135631,-0.014861356,0.080780126,-0.10029136,-0.10348245,-0.044447307,0.027648503,-0.005082948,0.11433215,-0.010621767,0.12983172,-0.009727122,-0.00096729875,-0.013710285,0.06578201,-0.015567954,0.03521594,-0.03166016,0.05643668,0.05689255,0.030497689,-0.06500703,0.11478802,-0.024206687,0.046202403,-0.20040037,0.006866539,0.11980259,-0.0014167578,0.08251243,-0.06847164,0.00063251937,0.034828454,-0.057576355,0.08055219,0.058807205,-0.01949983,-0.07052306,-0.090946026,-0.124361284,0.05734842,-0.049780983,-0.01764216,-0.024206687,-0.04278338,0.004253835,-0.115882106,-0.10831466,-0.0022294882,0.056710202,0.053610288,0.032891005,0.006353685,-0.009105999,-0.088575505,-0.0654629,0.01828038,0.14988999,-0.0021383143,-0.030885179,-0.13876677,0.11597328,-0.008917953,-0.044971555,-0.025619883,-0.03311894,-0.003074272,-0.043512773,-0.0311587,-0.02618972,0.08985194,0.00024057817,-0.001054199,-0.054202918,0.020365983,0.04519949,-0.06222623,0.047000177,0.02814996,-0.05055596,0.01684439,-0.029403603,-0.08875785,0.009123094,-0.057713117,-0.07284799,-0.047000177,0.071480386,-0.022007115,0.09217688,-0.08342417,-0.013892632,0.024252273,-0.1291935,-0.0829683,-0.06965691,-0.0075674388,-0.04433334,-0.09427387,0.020753473,0.010747131,-0.0005299486,0.0075845337,0.016342932,0.047775157,-0.07284799,0.033004973,-0.04082314,-0.04590609,-0.091675416,-0.06929221,-0.06701286,0.022770697,0.05552494,0.054886725,-0.107220575,-0.05739401,-0.0047524427,0.033939507,-0.10202366,-0.06272768,0.033255704,0.05465879,0.08916813,0.022747902,-0.027830852,0.0014644817,-0.064779095,0.022941647,-0.055297006,0.05237944,-0.041620914,0.023682436,0.07895665,-0.06053951,0.020753473,-0.028332308,-0.08014191,-0.05798664,-0.0019317482,0.005516025,-0.0794581,-0.11670267,-0.026873525,0.0059889895,-0.10630884,-0.05388381,0.06787901,-0.0689731,0.020662298,0.029038906,-0.045450218,-0.08456385,0.0168102,-0.023135392,0.043535564,-0.012091947,-0.01711791,0.037381325,0.0033477938,0.008832477,-0.1050324,0.0689731,-0.045495804,0.10594414,-0.005892117,-0.05237944,0.04127901,-0.099106096,-0.04579212,-0.055661704,-0.028902145,-0.033164527,0.059901293,0.012502229,-0.013812855,0.0570749,-0.06655699,-0.03729015,0.029631536,-0.0017137856,0.024047133,0.02286187,0.08565793,-0.045153905,0.014428279,-0.12062315,-0.009898073,0.06578201,0.011054843,-0.10193249,0.09773848,-0.012741561,-0.11123223,-0.023522882,-0.050373614,-0.06067627,0.051376525,0.04043565,0.022713713,0.026964698,0.059126314,-0.07234654,-0.077680215,-0.021471467,0.054567616,0.026166927,0.1004737,-0.010758528,0.01088959,-0.09700909,-0.039683465,-0.12700532]},{"file":"Donate money.md","text":"# Donate money\n\n# Зачем?\n\nНаш домик требует деняк на аренду и ЖКХ.

Яркость регулируется программно ШИМом, это не яркость! \n\nЕсли внутри лампы есть синее свечение, значит напряжение слишком высокое, в идеале такого быть не должно, работа в таком режиме снижает срок службы ламп.\n\nОтстроено по верхнему сегменту тройки на 4-й лампе, он загорается при вроде-адекватном напряжении.\n\nГорящая точка может искажать другие цифры.","embedding":[-0.027984627,0.06426868,-0.14337258,-0.050237462,0.08117876,0.009719406,-0.020165011,-0.07967449,0.016209817,-0.09222737,0.022797486,0.014874128,-0.094769076,0.0017749749,0.10758131,-0.015237228,-0.13714802,0.022641871,-0.11245722,0.09212363,0.012111975,0.013810764,0.02065779,0.02006127,-0.03649154,-0.00072133687,0.10509148,0.027439978,0.11971922,-0.0936279,0.029229542,-0.07121945,0.049615007,-0.104884,-0.07059699,0.06167511,0.06499488,0.054828085,-0.059289027,0.04307921,-0.06587669,-0.0484479,-0.08719584,-0.07427987,-0.03581721,-0.060430195,-0.13185713,0.07931139,0.013447664,0.07308682,0.054257497,0.107996285,-0.06893711,0.0013300155,-0.009816665,0.057058554,-0.029125798,0.108722486,0.040511575,-0.00824107,0.12418016,0.031823114,0.045698714,-0.07651033,-0.05954838,0.02131915,0.012390784,0.014342446,-0.029281413,0.05726604,0.07822209,0.002298552,0.07116758,-0.115154535,0.052934777,0.020865276,0.0036569347,0.0020067752,0.10695885,0.09378351,-0.09591024,-0.04743641,-0.112042256,0.009777761,-0.043027338,0.01162568,-0.030604133,-0.059911482,-0.12521759,-0.041834295,-0.08444666,0.03931853,-0.03879982,0.04084874,-0.00972589,-0.05122302,-0.04948533,-0.06489114,-0.030681942,-0.04012254,0.12552883,0.042793915,0.00776126,-0.026545195,0.108722486,0.054153755,-0.05085992,0.009077498,-0.111834764,0.022239868,0.0022628903,-0.012150878,-0.04943346,0.02754372,0.054101884,0.03981131,-0.021902705,0.06504675,0.110589854,-0.1656773,-0.015600327,-0.057421654,0.04691769,-0.033016153,-0.0031106637,-0.0987113,0.04940752,-0.07381302,-0.015691103,-0.033664547,0.02361446,-0.14638112,0.07573226,-0.07635472,0.005320062,0.027388107,0.03581721,0.010516929,-0.05181954,0.06053394,0.07988197,-0.02271968,0.03859233,-0.013142919,0.07308682,0.16256501,0.024146143,0.013162371,-0.07303495,0.09746639,-0.007586194,-0.026104288,0.012410236,-0.16121635,0.0111329025,-0.025092795,0.006879446,0.08916696,-0.13860041,0.0022531645,0.013188307,0.06255692,-0.0676922,-0.055191185,-0.03262712,0.02488531,-0.03148595,-0.03885169,-0.14067528,0.055554282,-0.016015299,-0.043779474,0.023510719,-0.0151205165,-0.0229531,0.040796865,0.0010811947,-0.003987615,0.01600233,0.034727912,-0.038514525,-0.049277842,0.013616246,-0.035091013,0.0032192697,-0.11090108,-0.09684393,0.039474145,-0.10182358,0.003193334,0.011307968,0.012416719,-0.026143191,0.01679337,-0.05472434,-0.08543222,0.061000783,-0.0050055915,0.02338104,-0.02253813,-0.0078066476,0.047566086,0.14721107,0.024340661,0.009900956,-0.011385775,-0.082734905,0.06421681,-0.024016464,0.02156554,0.059704,0.061571367,0.050211526,-0.03558379,-0.037788324,0.06857401,0.023808978,0.014485092,-0.03594689,0.061830726,-0.07485045,-0.010867061,-0.054776214,-0.0077353246,-0.0056345323,0.068055294,0.04017441,0.043260757,0.017467698,0.07692531,-0.0117488755,0.00013160345,0.003634241,0.008928367,0.013104016,-0.052286383,-0.004613314,-0.063386865,-0.048318222,-0.047643892,-0.017195374,0.10177171,-0.09284983,-0.09710328,0.031719368,-0.018738547,-0.08989316,-0.07578413,-0.07635472,-0.044194445,0.08045256,-0.037788324,-0.03158969,-0.1438913,-0.06131201,-0.07479858]},{"file":"Plumbus.md","text":"# Plumbus\n\n* Веб интерфейс: [http://printer-plumbus.lan]\n* Конфиги: <https://github.com/hackerembassy/printer-plumbus/>\n\n## About\n\nPlumbus - Printer brought into space by @the_mihalich\n\n## Specification\n\nThat's basically Zav Pro 3 or something along those lines:\n\n<https://www.zav3d.ru/products/39837907>\n\nHotend is fullmetal.\n\n## GCode\n\nUniversal GCode preambles for our printers apply:\n\n```bash\n;

В 2007 году он с единомышленниками основал [hackerspaces.org], сайт на базе вики, на котором хранится список и карта хакспейсов по всему миру и документируются шаблоны того, как их строить и поддерживать.

Статус можно смотреть в боте хакерспейса [@HackerEmbassyBot] в Telegram, либо в основном чате спейса. В чате статус обычно находится в закреплённом сообщении.\\nЕсть 2 категории посетителей спейса: **Резиденты** и **Гости**.\\nЛюбому желающему посетить спейс нужно отметить это в боте командой `/going`.\\nЕсли посетитель передумал приходить — необходимо воспользоваться командой `/notgoing`.\\nВ момент посещения спейса, нужно использовать команду `/in` чтобы считаться находящимся в спейсе. При уходе, нужно использовать `/out`. Также можно настроить Автовход в спейс при подключении к местной WiFi-сети.\n\nКоманды бота желательно использовать в личных сообщениях с ботом, а не в основном чате, чтоб не засорять последний.\n\n### Резиденты\n\n* Могут посещать спейс когда угодно.\n* Могут открывать и закрывать спейс для гостей.\n  * Для открытия спейса можно использовать команду в Telegram-боте.\n    /open\n  * Для закрытия спейса можно использовать команду в Telegram-боте.\n    /close\n* Могут принудительно вводить посетителя в спейс, если он внутри, но не воспользовался командой `/in` при помощи команды\n  /inforce\n\n### Гости\n\n* Могут посещать спейс когда он в статусе **открыт**.\n* Если гость собирается в спейс, в котором есть резиденты а спейс закрыт, то можно:\n  * Использовать команду\n    /hey\n    Она тегнет в основном чате спейса всех резидентов, а также выдаст уведомление на аудиоколонку внутри.\n  * Спросить у кого-то из резидентов, кто сейчас в спейсе, в личных сообщениях, можно ли зайти.\n\nВ спейсе бывают закрытые мероприятия только для резидентов, поэтому лучше стоит заранее договориться с резидентом, который сможет тебя принять, когда закрыто, иначе можем не пустить.\n\n### Автовход\n\nАвтовход — отдельная фича спейса, позволяющая автоматически отмечаться, что посетитель внутри, так и то, что он уже не в спейсе.\n\n> Автовход позволяет автоматизации спейса отследить всех посетителей, которые подключены к Wi-Fi-сети и ввести их в спейс. Если посетитель 5 минут не подключен к Wi-Fi спейса — произойдёт его автовыход.\n\n#### Как подключить:\n1. Подключитесь к Wi-Fi спейса.\n2. В настройках Wi-Fi-соединения отключите рандомизацию MAC-адресов для этой Wi-Fi-сети. На iOS этот параметр называется «Частный адрес Wi-Fi».

Do-ocracy! Хочешь начать проект в спейсе, провести мероприятие, мастеркласс или что-то еще? Just do it.\n\nТебе не нужно чье-то разрешение. Не жди, пока это сделает кто-то другой. Единственная просьба - сначала публично заяви об этом в общем чатике. Так ты можешь найти желающих присоединиться к твоей инициативе, а резиденты подскажут, как сделать это максимально безопасно и комфортно для других участников спейса.\n\n### II. Love each other! Наша задача создать пространство, где будет приятно и комфортно проводить время.\n\nНе притесняй и не мешай другим. Если у кого-то возникли трудности, не стесняйся предложить свою помощь, но не забывай соблюдать личные границы других участников.\n\n### III. For Science! Спейс существует, в первую очередь, для общения, обмена опытом и создания интересных проектов, а поддерживается за счет добровольных пожертвований участников.\n\nМы не предоставляем платных услуг, таких как коворкинг, аренда оборудования и помещений, репетиционная точка и тому подобное. Ты можешь воспользоваться спейсом таким образом, но только при возможности и согласии его резидентов.\n\n### IV. Dying is strictly prohibited! Тут все просто - безопасность тебя и других участников спейса превыше всего.\n\nМетоды взрывотехники и терморектального криптоанализа лучше практиковать в другом месте.\nВ спейсе нельзя быть в нетрезвом состоянии (мы будем вынуждены отправить домой). Употребить чего-нибудь алкогольного можно (строго в рамках законодательства Армении), но только до тех пор, пока остаешься в пределах адекватного психического состояния.\n","embedding":[0.028942397,0.075583905,-0.05111464,0.07161853,0.09038152,0.0050594793,-0.056192257,-0.03950867,0.0021247396,-0.02342956,0.026185978,-0.13008362,0.08854391,-0.015293288,0.052420314,-0.012827019,-0.07887226,0.034455236,-0.018908065,0.045384195,-0.057884794,0.10319645,-0.12495765,0.0057002255,-0.04494897,-0.11267466,0.089849584,0.014543736,0.014447019,-0.079646,0.1258281,-0.058851957,-0.043764193,-0.013238064,-0.08051644,0.0823057,-0.03237583,0.040862698,0.0019403738,-0.07698629,0.0008183118,-0.055466883,-0.044683,0.057836436,-0.13549975,-0.043208074,-0.043135535,-0.0483824,0.07935584,-0.015547169,-0.0882054,0.009133659,0.015063587,0.0914454,-0.079742715,-0.07219883,-0.06784659,0.11161078,-0.036945682,0.043183893,0.12118571,0.022438215,0.09497555,-0.02966777,-0.008190674,0.1005851,0.05527345,-0.0007707092,0.009822764,0.044779714,0.05914211,0.041805685,0.07166689,-0.03975046,-0.03215822,-0.046496432,-0.042917922,0.07514868,-0.012633586,0.007852167,0.000008169895,-0.027660904,-0.06373614,0.09255764,-0.084191665,-0.044803895,-0.0931863,-0.05150151,0.018098066,-0.08225734,-0.07461674,0.005763696,-0.033367176,-0.057594646,0.06097972,-0.040669266,0.109579735,-0.060834646,-0.054064494,-0.051017925,0.1675129,-0.060883004,-0.05087285,-0.081580326,0.14207646,0.027080605,-0.047415238,0.017106721,-0.115576155,-0.025097918,-0.083708085,0.0069273156,-0.030876726,0.04004061,0.0131776165,-0.057594646,-0.00207487,-0.013963438,0.01879926,-0.08627107,0.043353148,-0.03677643,0.017251797,0.003932128,0.022426127,-0.14188303,0.0033911206,-0.0028138442,-0.08796361,-0.04627882,0.18076304,-0.017650751,0.13250153,-0.045432553,0.006594853,0.028531352,-0.1246675,-0.0823057,-0.014567915,-0.064945094,0.04872091,-0.07785674,0.034697026,-0.025774933,0.083224505,-0.048116434,-0.014410751,0.09279943,-0.08926928,-0.0123917945,-0.022426127,-0.05425793,-0.047802106,0.052807182,-0.010324481,-0.022752544,0.012180228,0.08641615,-0.07447167,-0.0047965315,0.052807182,0.13095407,-0.08796361,-0.09425018,0.005391942,0.052807182,-0.016127467,-0.0010245899,-0.043788373,0.051404793,-0.01157575,-0.066637635,-0.11925138,0.049397927,-0.029208368,-0.06397793,0.09207406,-0.023320753,0.029014934,-0.038275536,-0.013818363,0.045239117,-0.04710091,-0.016659409,-0.0967648,0.008873734,-0.021180902,0.0209512,-0.036848966,-0.025920007,0.046689864,-0.0017484521,0.027685083,0.022619558,-0.028555531,-0.0784854,0.0033064936,-0.00504739,0.040234044,0.07268241,-0.00979254,-0.025242994,0.03955703,-0.02235359,-0.009544704,0.061173152,-0.04195076,0.034116726,-0.03759852,-0.08003286,0.09671645,-0.09492719,0.08844719,-0.044610463,-0.029740307,-0.013745825,0.0069938083,-0.024904486,-0.028676426,0.092606,-0.120218545,-0.065767184,-0.03428598,0.066782705,0.030102994,0.05333912,0.13598333,-0.0006970385,-0.033802398,0.01414478,-0.09749018,0.031432845,0.01691329,-0.10774212,0.07002271,-0.0626239,-0.013371049,-0.011775227,-0.0034122772,0.008789107,0.12002511,0.028410457,-0.036317028,-0.06649256,0.12205616,-0.023163589,-0.070119426,-0.022184335,-0.033391353,0.032061502,0.06600898,0.07717972,-0.0052922033,0.005537017,-0.046399716,-0.14546154]},{"file":"Присоединиться к нам.md","text":"# Присоединиться к нам\n\n## Как Гость\nЕсли вы находитесь в Ереване, увлечены технологиями и ищете единомышленников, заходите к нам.\n\n* Каждую пятницу, в 20:00 у нас происходит день открытых дверей.

Код подъезда: `#4230`\n\nРасключение реализовано многопроводочным ПуГВ 6 мм². Кабель на всём пути от вводного трёхполюсного автомата в контактах с устройствами нами было оконцовано с использованием соответствующего НШВИ наконечника.\n\nНаш однополюсный автомат заменен на Legrand C63.\n\nЕсть косяк - нейтраль (N) объединена после двух счётчиков. Если к нам добавят второго потребителя соседа, то это может повлиять на увеличение счетов за электроэнергию.\n\n# Заземление\n\nИспользуется система TT с изолированной землёй (PE), поскольку заземление реализовано отдельно для нашего спейса и находится после счётчика. Соответственно, чтобы не считать балансирующие токи нуля (N) соседнего дома по нашему (PEN) до разделения при реализации системы TN-C-S.\n\nВбита стальная арматура общей длиной 1 м 95 см и ⌀22 мм. Снаружи земли осталось где-то 17-23 см. Расположение арматуры в земле, где растёт дерево, слева от здания, если смотреть на вход.\n\nВбитая гладкая стальная арматура ⌀22 мм соединена стандартной арматурой ⌀16 мм и сваркой доведена до внешнего шкафчика. Углы усилены приваренной диагональной арматурой.\n\nВ шкафчике арматура соединена через болтовое соединение и многопроволочный провод 16 мм² через обжатый пресс-клещами наконечник (был куплен готовый обжатый наконечником провод). Заземление изолировано от трубы, проъодящей рядом. Арматура заземления также приварена к швеллеру, расположенному в доме выше шкафчика. \n\n## Сопротивление заземления\n\nБыли проведены замеры заземления устройством Chauvin Arnoux CA6116\n\n### Методика замера:\n\n* Использовался трёхточечный метод\n* В CA6116 был выбран режим усреднённых показаний. Прибор автоматически проводит несколько замеров самостоятельно и показывает среднее значение.\n* При проведении измерений CA6116 был подключен к сети 230В, подзаряжая аккумулятор, поскольку он был практически разряжен. Полагаю, это не должно сильно влиять при измерении сопротивления заземления.\n* Замер производился с отдельно вбитого заземлителя, а не всей системы и НЕ с точки внешнего шкафчика\n* В качестве \"колышков\" для измерения использовались прутки чёрного железа примерно ⌀6 мм длиной примерно 25-30 см\n* Для соединения колышков использовался медный армянских провод 1.5 мм²\n* Длина провода для каждого колышка составляля 30 м\n* Провод был размотан полностью\n* Измерения производились в августе 2024 года позним вечером (около 22:00 AMT)\n* Дистанция от заземлителя до дальнего колышка составляла примерно 26 м по прямой\n* Дистанция от заземлителя до ближнего колышка составляла примерно 16-18 м по прямой\n* Прямые дистанции от дополнительных колышков и заземлителя составляют 61-69% (\\~66%), что соответствует рекомендации из руководства по прибору\n* 2 колышка и заземлитель не были на одной прямой. Средний (ближний колышек) был на 2-3 м в стороне от прямой между заземлителем и дальним колышком, что согласуется и с методикой замеров, описанной в руководстве прибора.\n* Наш заземлитель также находился в сухом грунте\n* Дальний колышек был вбит примерно наполовину рядом с большим деревом в полупесочный сухой грунт\n* Ближний колышек был вбит полностью в увлажнённый ранее примерно чернозём, рядом с кустарником. Увлажнение было произведено жителями ранее\n\n### Результаты измерений:\n\nПервый замер (22:13 AMT)\n\n* **219.5 Ом** — сопротивление заземлителя\n* **\\~230 Ом** — сопротивление ближнего колышка в увлажнённом почве\n* **\\~480 Ом** — cопротивление жальнего колышка в сухой почве глубиной \\~15 см\n\nБыло произведён ещё один усреднённый замер без изменения конфигурации. Получил те же значения: **219.7 Ом** (22:13 AMT).\n\nДалее наш заземлитель **был полит примерно 1.5 л воды**. Сразу после этого сопротивление заземления стало меняться, а сопротивление измерительных колышков оставалось таким же:\n1. **194.5 Ом** (22:18 AMT),\n2. **172.9 Ом** (22:19 AMT)\n\nДалее передвинул ближний колышек на 1-2 м. Получил следующие результаты в 22:22 AMT\n* **125.2 Ом** — сопротивление заземлителя\n* **\\~130 Ом** — сопротивление ближнего *передвинутого* колышка в увлажнённом почве\n* **\\~480 Ом** — cопротивление жальнего колышка в сухой почве глубиной \\~15 см\n\nДалее заземлитель был дополнительно полит подсоленной водой (1 ложка соли на 1-1.5л воды). Падение сопротивления продолжилось:\n1. **102.1 Ом** (22:23 AMT),\n2. **99.7 Ом** (22:25 AMT),\n3. **91.0 Ом** (22:30 AMT)\n\n### Рассуждения\nУвлажнение почвы снижает сопротивление заземления более чем в 2 раза! Всё-таки сказывается сухой летний климат Армении.\nДля \"автоматического\" увлажнения можно использовать конденсат из относительно часто включенного кондиционера, перенаправив его в дерево.\nПолучили сопротивление заземления выше минимально требуемого для повторных заземлителей ВЛ ПУЭ [2.4.38]\n> Уже упоминавшийся мною выше технический циркуляр № 31/2012, в пункте 2 даёт чёткое разъяснение по поводу сопротивления повторного заземления на вводе в дом:\n> «При питании от ВЛИ сопротивление повторного заземления у потребителя выбирается из условия обеспечения надёжного срабатывания УЗО при повреждении изоляции (однофазное замыкание на землю) при отключенном PEN проводнике ответвления от ВЛИ. Сопротивление рассчитывается по току надёжного срабатывания УЗО, равному 5 IΔn, но должно быть не более 30 Ом. При удельном сопротивлении грунта более 300 Ом·м допускается увеличение сопротивления до 150 Ом.»\n\nТам в конце статьи есть и ПО для Win и Android по расчётам длин заземлителей в зависимости от грунта и климата.\n\nПоскольку мы не делаем повторный заземлитель (разделение PEN в системе TN-C-S), а делаем TT, то нам справедливы рачсчёты как раз из приведённого выше абзаца. Т.е. не более 150 Ом:\n\n220 В / 150 Ом = 1.4(6) А = 48.(8) \\* 30 мА, т.е. в 48 раз выше уставки отработки наших дифов по линиям 50 В / 150 Ом = 0.(3) А = 11.(1) \\* 30 мА, т.е. в 11 раз выше уставки отработки наших дифов по линиям.\n\nПри напряжение меньше 50 В уже не нужно заземлять устройства, согласно [ПУЭ 1.7.53]\n\n> 1.7.53. Защиту при косвенном прикосновении следует выполнять во всех случаях, если напряжение в электроустановке превышает 50 В переменного и 120 В постоянного тока.\n\nХотя пишут, что вне России используется 25 В как безопасное. Считаем для 25 В: 25 В / 150 Ом = 0.1(6) А = 5.(5) \\* 30 мА, т.е. в 5 раз выше уставки отработки наших дифов по линиям.\n\n### Выводы\nКороче говоря, 150 Ом для нашего заземления при использовании заземления только для спейса (система TT), будет достаточно. Перенаправлением потока кондиционера на заземление полностью решит эту проблему в летний период времени\nГибким шлангом был перенаправлен конденсат из кондиционера в сторону заземлителя. Для увеличения устойчивости шланга от сильных ветров, он дополнительно был обёрнут вокруг дерева\n\n# Наружний шкафчик\nМеталлический шкафчик IP65 на четырёх дюбелях. Ввод кабелей снизу.\nВсе входящие/отходящие кабели введены в шкафчик через сальники IP68 (или IP54).\nВсе многопроволочные провода защищены наконечниками НШВИ соответствующего диаметра.\nВвод идёт воздушной линией алюминиевым однопроводочным кабелем с двойной изоляцией 2х16 мм² из соседнего многоквартирного дома, где располагается шкафчик со счётчиком. В шкафчик заходят разделённые провода (фаза и ноль) этого кабеля для обеспечения герметичности.\nДалее алюминиевый кабель вводной входит в выключатель нагрузки IEK ВН32 63А для разделения алюминия и меди.\nНе гильзовали, чтобы оставить возможность простых изменений. Это же Хакер Спейс!\nОт выключателя нагрузки установлен УЗИП Legrand T1+T2 12.5 кА L+N с удалённой индикацией срабатывания (пригодности для дальнейшех эксплуатации), от которой в дом отходит медный многопроволочный кабель в двойной изоляции 3x0.75 мм². УЗИП подключен рекомендуемым методом при котором вводной провод идёт к УЗИП и уже от него внутрь.\\n ![Расключение дистанционного показания работоспособности УЗИП Legrand]\nСхема контактов дистанционного модуля отличается от приведённого в Manual.

Для двойного соединения проводов используются наконечники НШВИ 2х6мм². Однако провода чёрные и красные не являются ГОСТ ПуГВ, а, скорее, предназначены для постоянного тока, но брал по наличию.
